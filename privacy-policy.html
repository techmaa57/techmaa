                            We have adopted and implemented the following

                            protecting your privacy and personal information.
                            This policy describes what information we collect
                            from visitors to our site and how we will use that
                            information. Our site is intended for customers and
                            users located in the United States.

                            You do not need to sign in or register to browse our
                            site. This means you may browse the web pages
                            without providing any personal identifying
                            information ("PII").
                            <br />
                            If you make an inquiry or choose to make a purchase
                            while accessing our site, we will ask that you
                            provide certain PII needed to respond to the inquiry
                            or complete the transaction. For example, if you ask
                            us for additional information about a product, we
                            will ask for your email address in order that we may
                            respond to your inquiry. If you purchase one of our
                            products, we will ask that you provide us with the
                            information needed in order to process your order,
                            charge your credit card account, send a message
                            confirming your order and deliver the product you
                            have purchased. This information may include your
                            first and last name, your credit card number,
                            expiration date and security code, your billing and
                            shipping address, email address, and telephone
                            number. Except as otherwise outlined in this policy,
                            we do not give, sell, or trade to other firms or our
                            affiliates any PII about you or your transactions
                            with us, nor will we contact you using this

                            transaction unless you specifically authorize us to.
                            <br />
                            In responding to any inquiry or fulfilling any
                            transaction with you, we may employ third-party
                            companies to perform functions on our behalf. These
                            functions may include order fulfillment, package
                            delivery, marketing assistance, postal and email
                            delivery, customer service, data analysis, and
                            credit card processing. The third parties who
                            perform these services for us have limited access to
                            your PII and have promised us they will not use it
                            for other purposes.

                            If you make a purchase through our website we may
                            use this information, alone or in conjunction with
                            other publicly available information, to identify
                            other products or services that we think you may be
                            interested in purchasing and in sending you
                            information about those other products or services.
                            Sometimes we share some of this information, such as
                            your name and email address, with our affiliate
                            companies and with other companies who offer
                            products and services that we think may be of
                            interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these
                            messages or prefer that we not share your
                            information with any other companies, please
                            deselect the "opt-in" or remove the checkmark from
                            the box on the Checkout page. If you decline to
                            "opt-in" by following the process above, we will not
                            give, sell, or trade to another firm or our
                            affiliates any of the information you provide us,
                            except as otherwise outlined in this policy, nor
                            will we contact you regarding other products or
                            services. If you "opt-in" and later decide that you
                            no longer wish to receive messages from us, please
                            Contact Us and we will honor your request within 10
                            days.
                            <br />
                            If you keep the "opt-in" box marked or if you
                            otherwise give us authorization, you may receive
                            periodic emails regarding products or services that
                            we think may be of interest to you. Upon receipt of
                            these emails, you may opt-out of receiving further
                            emails by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link at the
                            bottom of the email received or clicking the
                            following link: unsubscribe to unsubscribe from
                            future emails. It may take us up to 10 days to
                            complete this process. If you choose, you may once
                            again authorize us to send you emails regarding
                            products or services that we think may be of
                            interest to you.

                            Some of the pages on our website use "cookies" to
                            help us better serve visitors to our site. Cookies
                            are brief text messages transmitted by a website to
                            the hard drive of your computer when you click on a

                            your computer will transmit the text message back to
                            the website server to permit the server to recall
                            previous visits to our site or to keep track of a

                            reject cookies by changing the settings on your
                            browser. Doing this, however, could diminish your

                            Some pages of our website use "action tags," which
                            are also known as a clear GIFs or web beacons. An
                            action tag is an invisible tag that may be placed on
                            certain pages of our site but not on your computer.
                            When you access these pages, the action tags
                            generate a generic code of that visit. Action tags
                            are not linked to any PII.

                            Like most websites, we use log files to analyze
                            trends, administer the site, track user movement and
                            gather other information. The log files contain
                            information such as Internet protocol addresses,
                            browser type used, Internet Service Provider (or
                            ISP) information, referring/exit pages, platform
                            type, date/time, and the number of clicks. On
                            occasion, we may share information from our log
                            files with our business partners and advertisers.
                            This information is provided on an aggregated and
                            anonymous basis. The contents of the log files are
                            not linked to any PII.
                            <br />
                            For website analytics, we use two methods of
                            tracking user behavior. Server log files and
                            javascript tracking tags are used to analyze trends,
                            administer the site, track user movement, and gather
                            other information. These tracking methods provide us
                            with information such as internet protocol
                            addresses, browser type used, Internet Service
                            Provider information, referring/exit pages, platform
                            type, date/time, number of visitors, geographic
                            location, and eCommerce data. On occasion, we may
                            share this information with our business partners
                            and advertisers. This information is provided on an
                            aggregated and anonymous basis. The contents of
                            these tracking methods are not linked to any PII.
                            The log-based tracking utility used is Urchin
                            Tracking by Google, and our javascript tracking
                            utility is Google Analytics.

                            be used by children) are intended to be purchased by
                            adults. If you are under 18 years old and you want

                            will promptly delete any PII in that user's account,
                            and if, before shipment, we learn that a user under

                            without adult involvement, the order will not be
